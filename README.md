## Mount NTFS

It's a bash script I've created to mount NTFS drives in my MacBook. I created one after facing difficulty readin and writing to my external hard disk which had important data and was in NTFS format. Formatting the external harddisk to exFAT was out of the question. And also the available software which could do this was quite expensive. Hence, I wrote the script. I welcome all your ideas and contributions on how to improve it so everyone can benefit from it.
